<p1 class="content">The jumbo jets that we sit on in modern day are sitting on the foundation laid hundreds of years BC. Without the 
  success (and many, MANY failures) of the geniuses before us aviation would not be where it is today. 

The first ever records of the idea of human flight originated in ancient Greece before 347 BC. These were in the form of ancient myths
  (mainly two) of men crafting wings from feathers to allow for flight. The first story was about a father and son (Icarus and Daedalus)
  who were imprisoned on a tall tower in Crete. They used feathers and wax to create two wings which Icarus used to fly towards the sun.
  However not long after taking flight the wax melted causing Icarus to fall to his death leaving his father in deep regret. The second 
  of the two was of a man named Shah Kay Kavus. He crafted a flying craft carried by eagles who tried to fly towards food which caused 
  them to lift the craft. </p1>
